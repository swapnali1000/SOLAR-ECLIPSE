## EARTH ROTATION AND REVOLUTION🌌
These are the three objects Earth, Sun, and Moon that have the greatest impact on our lives.

The Earth🌍, of course, is the planet beneath our feet. Without it, well, we wouldn’t have anything at all. The Sun🌞 warms our planet, and with the Moon🌚, creates the tides.🤗
